# Project 01: My Traffic

## Description

Our mission with this application is to show potential homeowners the traffic around the listings they are interested in.

## How?
 
 The "How?" is very easy you just simply put in your city or zipcode and our application will show you a traffic map with the area listings to the side so you can see how brutal your commute might be!
